The Scots Shooter
=================
An alien invasion ripoff/clone/like-shooter-game
------------------------------------------------

this "game" is mostly done,but if you want to play it,then you need the pygame enviroment installed.
It's basicly a shoot-down-the-aliens-till-you-die type of thing,
but it is funnier to monty python fans(since it was written in python,the theme was an obvious choice...)













P.S.:Play around with the button c and v maybe you'll find something interesting ;)
